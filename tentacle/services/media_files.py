"""Safe removal of the media files Tentacle itself wrote.

Tentacle only ever creates ``.strm`` and ``.nfo`` files. In the merged-folder
setup the docs encourage (VOD folder and the *arr downloads folder mounted at
the same physical path), a recursive delete of a title's directory also takes
out downloaded ``.mkv`` files, subtitles and artwork that Tentacle never
created — bypassing Sonarr/Radarr's recycle bin. So every delete path removes
files by extension and only prunes directories that are already empty.
