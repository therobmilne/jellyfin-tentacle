    Evidence is a *run* of _SPLICE_RUN consecutive packets holding at least
    _SPLICE_RUN_CONTENT elementary-stream packets (PES PIDs; PAT/PMT/SI and
    null packets repeat byte for byte). A run seen twice while sending is
    ambiguous and never evidence. Evidence only decides whether to hold.

    The join point (the anchor) is everything sent from the last PES header
    before the drop (at least _SPLICE_RUN packets): a PES header carries a
    timestamp, so these bytes occur once in the stream, whereas a run of
    content packets can repeat byte for byte (digital silence on a radio
    channel, a looping slate). Only bytes that end in the anchor, and whose
    bytes before the anchor equal what was sent before it, are dropped.

    After a re-dial, within the first _SPLICE_PROBE_PACKETS fresh packets:
    - the anchor is there: join right after it (drop what precedes it: the
      replay);
    - >= _SPLICE_PROBE_MATCHES remembered runs are there: the provider is
      replaying; hold until the anchor shows up and join after it;
    - otherwise (a real gap, a channel restart, a remuxed replay): send all.
    Holding past the bounds, or a connection breaking while holding, sends
    everything held (a repeat of part of the replay, never a loss). No join
    within _SPLICE_AFTER_GAP s of a gap: a replay reaching back over the gap
    would hold seconds the stream never had. Every re-dial that is not joined
    is counted as a miss and logged: nothing lost is ever reported as joined.

    Only a miss that may have skipped something restarts that window. A
    re-dial too soon after a gap is sent as it comes, but watched for the
    anchor: a connection that has it started at or before the drop, so sent
    whole it skipped nothing. What a broken hold sends is set aside: the
    stream's position stays the drop before it, so the next re-dial can only
    join there, and that join drops nothing the stream did not already have,

    for as long as the client keeps reading. `is_recording`, when given, is
